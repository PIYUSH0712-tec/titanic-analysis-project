# Titanic Dataset Analysis 

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

##  Objectives
- Explore the Titanic dataset
- Clean and preprocess missing values
- Perform feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, etc.)
- Analyze relationships using visual and statistical methods
- Summarize key insights

##  Project Files
- **titanic_analysis.ipynb** – Full Jupyter Notebook with code, visuals, and explanations  
- **titanic_report.pdf** – Clean PDF report generated from the notebook  
- **train.csv** – Titanic dataset (Kaggle)  
- **README.md** – Project explanation  

##  Data Cleaning Steps
- Handled missing values for Age, Embarked, and Cabin  
- Extracted Title from passenger names  
- Created FamilySize and IsAlone features  
- Generated Deck information from Cabin column  

##  Analysis Included
- Univariate Analysis (Age, Fare, Survival, etc.)
- Bivariate Analysis (Survival vs Sex, Class, Title, etc.)
- Multivariate Analysis (Heatmap, Pairplot)
- Summary of insights

##  Key Insights
- Females survived at a much higher rate  
- 1st class passengers had better survival than 2nd/3rd  
- Children had higher survival  
- Higher fare → better survival  
- Passengers alone had lower survival  
- Titles from names provided strong survival signals
